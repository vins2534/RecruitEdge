# RecruitEdge

## AI-Powered Resume Screening & Recruitment Solution

RecruitEdge is a sophisticated AI-driven platform that leverages NLP, vector embeddings, and machine learning to streamline and optimize the candidate selection process.

## Problem Domain

Modern recruitment faces several technical challenges:

- **Scale Limitations**: Traditional systems cannot efficiently process high-volume applications
- **Semantic Matching Deficiency**: Keyword-based ATS fail to capture contextual relevance
- **Bias Propagation**: Algorithmic reinforcement of historical selection patterns
- **Resource Intensity**: Manual screening consumes disproportionate HR bandwidth
- **Context Extraction Failure**: Inability to distinguish between superficial keyword matches and substantive experience

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: ReactJS (v18+)
- **State Management**: Redux with middleware for async operations
- **UI Components**: Custom component library with responsive design
- **API Integration**: Axios with request interceptors for authentication

### Backend
- **Framework**: Flask RESTful API framework
- **Authentication**: JWT-based token system with refresh mechanism
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI 3.0
- **Testing**: Pytest for unit and integration tests

### AI & NLP Pipeline
- **Text Processing**: LangChain for document processing and chunking
- **Embedding Generation**: Gemini API for contextual embeddings
- **Vector Operations**: FAISS/HNSWlib for efficient similarity search
- **Prompt Engineering**: Multi-level chain-of-thought prompting with few-shot examples
- **Skill Taxonomy**: Hierarchical skill classification system with weighted relevance scoring

### Database Schema
- **Vector Store**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
  - Dimensionality: 1536
  - Indexing: HNSW for approximate nearest neighbor search
  - Query optimization: Hybrid filtering with metadata constraints
- **Relational Data**: MySQL
  - User profiles and authentication
  - Application tracking
  - Analytics and metrics storage

### Cloud Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Aiven for managed PostgreSQL and MySQL
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with Docker containers
- **Storage**: Object storage for resume PDFs and documents
- **Caching**: Redis for API response and frequent queries

## Core Technical Features

### Vector-Based Skill Matching
```python
def generate_skill_embedding(skill_text):
    # Preprocess and normalize skill text
    normalized_text = preprocess_text(skill_text)
    
    # Generate embedding using Gemini API
    embedding = gemini_client.embed_text(normalized_text)
    
    return embedding

def match_candidate_to_job(candidate_skills, job_requirements):
    # Generate embeddings for both sets
    candidate_embeddings = [generate_skill_embedding(skill) for skill in candidate_skills]
    job_embeddings = [generate_skill_embedding(req) for req in job_requirements]
    
    # Calculate similarity matrix
    similarity_scores = cosine_similarity_matrix(candidate_embeddings, job_embeddings)
    
    # Calculate matching score with weighted importance
    match_score = calculate_weighted_match(similarity_scores, job_requirement_weights)
    
    return match_score
```

### Context-Aware Screening
The system employs a multi-stage ML pipeline:
1. Document parsing and normalization
2. Entity recognition for experience, skills, and qualifications
3. Contextual analysis of skill application (not just possession)
4. Temporal weighting of experience relevance
5. Semantic matching against job descriptions

### Multi-Level Chain-of-Thought Prompting
```python
def analyze_candidate_experience(resume_text, job_description):
    # First-level analysis: Extract experience sections
    experience_blocks = extract_experience_sections(resume_text)
    
    # Second-level analysis: For each experience, extract responsibilities
    responsibilities = []
    for block in experience_blocks:
        resp = extract_responsibilities(block)
        responsibilities.extend(resp)
    
    # Third-level analysis: Match responsibilities to job requirements
    job_requirements = extract_requirements(job_description)
    
    # Final analysis: Generate reasoning chain for each match
    reasoning_chains = []
    for resp in responsibilities:
        for req in job_requirements:
            relevance = calculate_relevance(resp, req)
            if relevance > THRESHOLD:
                chain = generate_reasoning_chain(resp, req, relevance)
                reasoning_chains.append(chain)
    
    return aggregate_reasoning_chains(reasoning_chains)
```
